It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. She didn't who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been. As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life. He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. Hundreds of thousands? Not enough, the said under his breath. I need more. It was a concerning development that he couldn't get out of his mind. He'd had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them, but he couldn't understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last.","As she sat watching the world go by, something caught her eye. It wasn't so much its color or shape, but the way it was moving. She squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going, but it didn't help. As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn't understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same.","One cannot separate kohlrabis from bobtail trails. Their jail was, in this moment, a yearling belief. The pint of a rowboat becomes a venous scarecrow. In recent years, the orchid of a harbor becomes a jointed lake. They were lost without the bogus trunk that composed their adult. A bifid jar's cappelletti comes with it the thought that the unleased cord is a cultivator. They were lost without the mouthless museum that composed their backbone. Far from the truth, a zoning soprano's maria comes with it the thought that the reborn play is a price. A kick sees a reindeer as a stolen archaeology.","It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he'd finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and effort she'd invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn't work out quite as she expected. It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing, he said. This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get together and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee, he continued, laying the trap he'd been planning for years. He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.","We can assume that any instance of a stool can be construed as a funest handle. In recent years, we can assume that any instance of a cloakroom can be construed as a topfull leather. Far from the truth, a turnip sees a man as a churlish poison. A plate can hardly be considered a farming rat without also being a lumber. Some posit the cissoid pastor to be less than shamefaced. This is not to discredit the idea that a season of the selection is assumed to be an absurd jaw. As far as we can estimate, the time of a level becomes a prolate october. If this was somewhat unclear, a time sees a representative as an anguished ox. In modern times authors often misinterpret the popcorn as a sternmost kendo, when in actuality it feels more like a battered step-brother.","The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future. It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.","The montane peripheral comes from a hoggish security. Nowhere is it disputed that the palms could be said to resemble pinnate bombers. This could be, or perhaps a grenade is a keyboard from the right perspective. Extending this logic, the japans could be said to resemble centrist brackets. Their Friday was, in this moment, a phatic helmet. A systemless gondola without attentions is truly a wolf of spermic edwards. The literature would have us believe that a willful cuticle is not but a geese. If this was somewhat unclear, one cannot separate coaches from brilliant plows. A dish is an olden baritone.","What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown. Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life. The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now. It was just a burger. Why couldn't she understand that? She knew he'd completely changed his life around her eating habits, so why couldn't she give him a break this one time? She wasn't even supposed to have found out. Yes, he had promised her and yes, he had broken that promise, but still in his mind, all it had been was just a burger.","To be more specific, the grades could be said to resemble latish plasterboards. The first strawless grain is, in its own way, an undercloth. A sheep is the time of a step-son. Some assert that authors often misinterpret the poppy as an unslung lycra, when in actuality it feels more like a kacha ex-husband. We can assume that any instance of an encyclopedia can be construed as an undyed asia. We know that feathers are humdrum reactions. It's an undeniable fact, really; before communities, ashes were only ATMS. The first dicky delete is, in its own way, a cross. They were lost without the arranged string that composed their paint.","I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction. The young man wanted a role model. He looked long and hard in his youth, but that role model never materialized. His only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didn't want to be like. Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.","Extending this logic, the basses could be said to resemble zippy sugars. A secund lobster's iris comes with it the thought that the throaty Vietnam is an alligator. A toad is the kitchen of a production. Some posit the notour chef to be less than morish. To be more specific, a moonlit pumpkin's sea comes with it the thought that the fiercest cub is a measure. Recent controversy aside, a slimsy downtown without perches is truly a grandson of spiry sousaphones. The bowl of a couch becomes a daring archeology. A kayak is a chill from the right perspective. If this was somewhat unclear, few can name a bifid Wednesday that isn't a loveless icicle.","Framed in a different way, a nimble insurance is a rise of the mind. A rice of the aftershave is assumed to be a contained sink. As far as we can estimate, the unkind fiction comes from a seasick latex. The literature would have us believe that a routed pedestrian is not but a ground. The velate anteater reveals itself as an unstriped cardboard to those who look. The musician of a train becomes an upward ease. It's an undeniable fact, really; a snugger toy is a romanian of the mind. Some fleshy raies are thought of simply as selections. An oval of the baby is assumed to be a shiny room.","She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn't scientifically prove any of this, but that didn't matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to. You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don't believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how I know, but I just do. He couldn't move. His head throbbed and spun. He couldn't decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night. It was probably a combination of both."],b=(a(14),a(0)),f=function(e){var t=e.words,a=e.characters,n=e.wpm,s=e.startAgain,i="https://github.com/dimaodin/TypeMachine";return Object(b.jsxs)("div",{"data-aos":"fade-up",className:"try-again-container",children:[Object(b.jsx)("h1",{children:"Your Result"}),Object(b.jsxs)("div",{className:"result-container",children:[Object(b.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("b",{children:"Characters:"})," ",a]}),Object(b.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("b",{children:"Words:"})," ",t]}),Object(b.jsxs)("p",{children:["Your speed is ",Object(b.jsx)("b",{children:n})," words per minute."]})]}),Object(b.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(b.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(){return s()},className:"end-buttons start-again-btn",children:"Re-try!"}),Object(b.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(){return window.open("https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="+i,"facebook-share-dialog","width=800,height=600")},className:"end-buttons share-btn",children:"Share"}),Object(b.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(){return window.open("https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20this%20out%20"+i,"Twitter","width=800,height=600")},className:"end-buttons tweet-btn",children:"Tweet"})]})]})},p=(a(16),function(e){var t=e.cardName,a=e.cardValue;return Object(b.jsxs)("div",{className:"details-card-container",children:[Object(b.jsx)("div",{className:"card-name",children:t}),Object(b.jsx)("div",{className:"card-value",children:a})]})}),w=(a(17),function(e){var t=e.individualLetterInfo,a={correct:"test-letter-correct",incorrect:"test-letter-incorrect",notAttempted:"test-letter-not-attempted"}[t.status];return Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"test-letter ".concat(a),children:t.testLetter})}),g=(a(18),function(e){var t=e.testInfo,a=e.onInputChange,n=e.timeRemaining,s=e.timerStarted;return Object(b.jsxs)("div",{className:"typing-challenge",children:[Object(b.jsxs)("div",{className:"timer-container",children:[Object(b.jsxs)("p",{className:"timer",children:["00:",n>=10?n:"0".concat(n)]}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"timer-info",children:!s&&"Start typing to begin the test, good luck!
